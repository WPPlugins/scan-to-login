== How It Works ==

With the Scan-to-Login plugin installed on your website, visitors can simply scan the QR Code, to either complete a new registration or use an existing login to enter your website straight from their mobile device.

In order to use Scan-to-Login you will need to register as a Merchant on the Zapper website. This will allow you to customize the desired login fields required to register and login to your website using Scan-to-Login (Please see Installation for more info on how to set this up)

= Registration and Login =  

**A new visitor to your site:** 

* A new visitor scans the QR Code on your website with the Zapper app.
* The required fields will be chosen by you when you register as a merchant on the Zapper website (see Installation for more info). These are loaded on the visitor’s mobile device.
* The visitor is prompted to complete these fields on their mobile. 
* If the visitor has previously completed their profile on the Zapper app they will already have all, or most of the fields saved on their device and these will automatically be passed to your website’s registration fields at scan.
* Any additional fields that your site may require will be prompted for at this point on the visitor’s device.
* The completed registration data is then passed to your site’s backend and the visitor will be registered on your website.
* The visitor will then automatically be logged into the site without having to type anything into the actual site. 
* The registration information is stored securely on the mobile device, using 128-bit SSL encryption, making subsequent logins to the site quick and easy for the user.

**A returning visitor to your site:**

* A visitor who has already registered on your site will scan the QR Code for the first time.
* The visitor is prompted on their mobile device for the username and password for your website.
* The visitor enters these login credentials on the device and is automatically logged into your site without typing anything into the website.
* The login information is stored securely on the mobile device, using 128-bit SSL encryption, making subsequent logins to the site quick and easy for the user.

= What is Zapper™? =
The Zapper app is a smartphone application that lets you register, login and pay both online and offline by scanning Zapper-enabled QR Codes.

= What is multi-factor authentication and how does it work? =
It may sound complicated, but it is pretty easy to explain. Authentication is a way of verifying that you are entitled to access the information you want to access. There are three broad ways to authenticate a user.
These are:
Something the user knows (e.g.: a username and password). This is the most popular online.
Something a user has: (e.g.: a security token, mobile phone or key fob)
Something the user is: (e.g.: a fingerprint, a retina pattern, their face) 

2-Factor Authentication occurs when a user has to use 2 of the three methods above to gain access. 3-Factor Authentication is when a user has to use all 3 of the methods above to be authenticated. Multi-factor Authentication occurs when a user is using the same method but multiple times (eg: using two passwords, using both a fingerprint and retina pattern and so on)

= How does Zapper security work. = 
A unique encryption key is generated when the code is created using the JavaScript library. This is encoded in the QR code, once scanned, the device receives the key and encrypts the data that the user has filled in. This encrypted data gets sent to the ZapperTech web service without the encryption key, and it is stored on the server encrypted. This way, ZapperTech will never know what information has been submitted by the user. The JavaScript plugin checks for the submitted data on the ZapperTech server and when it finds it, decrypts the data and returns it to the callback method. So the only places that know the unencrypted data are the merchant and the device.
